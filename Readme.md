Java version > 17
in order to run all the scenarios you need to run the test.feature

for the scenario i used cucumber with gherkin and the page object model to model the different pages


By running the DemoApplicationTests it will generate a report at ./target/reports

change the following configs depending your needs
headless=true or false for running locally
browser=Firefox or Chrome
